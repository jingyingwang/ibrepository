* **1906 Algeciras Conference **The resulting convention awarded France a controlling interest in Moroccan affairs, but guaranteed equality of trade and economic freedom for every nation and limited any colonial action by any nation without consultation with the other signatories.

	* **1911 Second Moroccan Crisis **French pushed troops into the country, claiming to be defending the sultan against riots that had erupted in Fez but actually violating the terms of the Algeciras convention. When the French pushed troops into the country, claiming to be defending the sultan against riots that had erupted in Fez but actually violating the terms of the Algeciras convention. In response, Germany sent its own warship, the Panther, which arrived in the port of Agadir on May 21, intensifying the enmity between the two nations and, by extension, their allies. Europe climate had shifted into large blocs of power.

* **Nationalism**: an form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries

	* 1871-1914 German Nationalism

		* 1871 German unification 

			* Treaty of Frankfurt → end of Franco-Prussian War.

			* Takes land of Alsace Lorraine.

			* France is humiliated - pay money, lose land, host German celebration in Hall of Mirrors.

			* It is Bismarck's Shortsightedness to challenge the most powerful - no wish to be friends with France.

			* France was humiliated in this war and had always wanted payback.

			* Despite created the new state of German Empire. In the eyes of some, it is not complete.

			* France is not dangerous, but if it allies with Austria or Russia it might be.

			* Hence, Prussia promises a generous peace, in return Austria does not interfere with 'German affairs'.

			* When Austria defeated, only Russia is more powerful than Germany.

			* Bismarck believes allies are made for reasons and there are no real friends: realpolitik, looking at own best practical interest.

		* **1884 MG-08** Germany produces MG-08, machine gun. Possibly what caused the war. Both Britain and Germany were practicing using these in Africa.

		* **1890-94 German New Course** Wilhelm II, German Emperor dismisses Bismarck and wishes to exert more personal control on the empire. More aggressive foreign policy.

		* 1896 Weltpolitik

			* Break from realpolitik of Bismarck's era, will transform Germany into a global power through:

			* Aggressive foreign policy

			* The acquisition of overseas colonies

			* The development of a large navy (Britain...)

	* 1914 Serbian Nationalism - Catalyst ([The BS in the Balkans][1])

		* Ottoman Empire Weakness

			* The Ottoman Empire dominated the Balkans for centuries.

			* Recently, it's been weaker - the sick man of Europe. Other powers have a chance to gain more territory.

			* Russia and A-H have ambitions in this area.

		* 1908-09 Bosnian Crisis

			* Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, territories formally within the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire. Germany is forced to support AH. The crisis permanently damaged relations between Austria-Hungary on one hand and Serbia, Italy and the Russian Empire on the other. Austria annexed Bosnia in the Balkans. This annoyed\*\* \*\*Serbia, as thousands of Serbians went under A-H control and also Serbia wanted to take over the area. Russia wanted to help Serbia, but had to back down seeing German support. Internally, Russia parliament is angry at not helping 'our Slavic brothers'.

		* 1911 Italian-Turkish War Colonial war, defeat leads to Balkan wars

		* 1912-13 Balkan Wars Serbia and other countries in the Balkans conquered most of Turkey's land in Europe with Russian support. Serbia became a powerful country, and said Austria-Hungary was its next target. AH threatens war, Russia supports Serbia.

		* 1914 Black Hands 

			* A Serbian nationalist movement that aimed to unite territories with a South Slavic majority under Serbian control using violent means, including lands held by A-H.

			* May be behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

* Industrialization: the development of industries in a country on a wide scale

	* They industrialized.

* Militarism: the belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend or promote national interests

The increased ability to produce weaponry due to industrialization empowered the motivation to imperialism abroad and domestically in Europe. 

	* 1870-14 Second Industrial Revolution

This is a period of massive improvements in technology and science fueled by nationalism.

	    * Louis Pasteur developed germ theory in 1860-5. 
	
	    * He has money from French government and therefore develop vaccinations to challenge German authority, showing that France is scientifically more advanced. 
	
	    * 'War on Science' - German pushes pharmaceutical industry. 
	
	    * Robert Koch is a German person who began to develop vaccines. 
	
	    * Both countries see science as a pathway to political deterrence. These vaccines were preparing for warfare.
	
	* Pre-1914 Arms race:
	
	    * Russia had the largest army in 1914 (1.3 million troops) but not the strongest (outdated weapons)
	
	    * Austria-Hungary's army more than doubled to 810000 by 1910.
	
	    * 1906 Naval arms race: 
	
	        * From 1815 onwards, Britain had the biggest navy in the world. It was always double the size of everyone else's.
	
	        * This is because Britain needs to keep the military and also the trade. It was a necessity.
	
	        * German King also wants to have a big navy. In Germany,
	
	        * 'In 1898, the Naval Act provided for 19 battleships and 8 cruisers.'
	
	        * 'In 1900, the second Naval Act provided for 38 battleships and 20 cruisers.'
	
	        * In 1906, Britain develops the HMS Dreadnought and destroys its own navy. 
	
	        * Dreadnought was a class of ships that is faster, better armed and can travel further, runs on steam power.
	
	        * It made all the other ships obsolete.
	
	        * Kaiser sees the ship and wants it. 
	
	        * They began competing who can make the most Dreadnoughts. 
	
	        * By 1914, Germany had 17 Dreadnoughts while Britain had 29. 
	
	        * Both sides received massive public support.
	
	        * It was economically impossible for the Germans to close the gap before the war broke out.
	
	        * By the time of war, Britain was still the biggest navy in the world.

* Military plans

New military weapons meant new plans. Rather than having a small conflict, every nation jumped in with their own plans and that's why WWI became such a large scale conflict.

	* 1903 Schlieffen Plan
	
	    * Aims to prevent war against eastern border with Russia and western border with France simultaneously
	
	    * reaction of German fear of encirclement - created in 1903, which means to attack the French first, just like in 1871. Launch attack from Alsace-Lorraine, main attack will come through Belgium to Northern France: need to move fast. Hit France first, then focus on all Russians. Changes and adaptions are relied on # of factors:
	
	    * Superiority of the German Military - higher mobility, greater firepower (after 1908, MG-08 machine gun), better training.
	
	    * Plan is based on Russian army of circa 1900s - huge armies, not industrialized, lacked railways → slow mobilizations. Early July, Russia starts to mobilize the armies since they know that they are slow. 
	
	    * For France and Russia, yet now it's Triple Entente - Britain will also get troops to help France, Britain will get troops to France through navy and land on certain ports. Adapted to ensure Britain does not get troops to France fast enough - changes plan at last minute. Break out from German Hook, German troops will capture certain deepwater ports.
	
	    * Schlieffen plan did not work, yet cannot stop. In Britain, mobilization is also growing out of control. The Plan is what started the fighting.
	
	* Russian plans:
	
	    * Rapidly move against Germany so it **mobilized first** in order to counter logistical problems
	
	* **1913 **France Plan XVII: launching against Germany on shared border
	
	* Britain plan:
	
	    * Send their army to France in the event of war
	
	    * Concentrate to destroy Germany's navy to hinder supplies, and hence weaken German economy and morale

* **Alliance systems:**

* **Alliance System: **The two power blocs of countries in World War I, Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/UjsEUwr4fapfE4SUwS9qcw\_img\_0.png)

**Date of Key Alliances:**

* 1879 Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria, forming Triple Alliance by 1882 with Italy.

* 1887 Reinsurance Treaty with Germany and Russia, a short alliance by Bismarck immediately after the collapse of Dreikaiserbund (G,R,A to isolate France). Breaks by 1890.

* 1891-92 Franco-Russian Alliance. Germany isolated.

* 1904 Entente Cordiale between France and Britain. Unite against should Germany attack. Defensive.

* 1907 **Triple Entente **between France, Britain and Russia against Germany.

#### Triple Alliance: Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary

* Secret alliance, defensive alliance

#### Triple Entente: Britain, France and Russia (much later than the triple alliance)

* Not an alliance: the agreement to not help the enemy. No one knew the full story behind the treaties.

* France goes to Russia first, and Russia dominates in Eastern Europe, yet they do not know yet the weakness of Russian society.

* In **1904**, all of Europe laughed at Russia: it lost the **Russo-Japanese** **War**. Britain, France and America impose peace settlement in which Japan gives back land from war to a divided up China, for the economic benefit of these countries.

*All alliances were formed with a motivation that is somewhat related to Germany: Germany fears isolation while others fear German strength.*

It is important to note that the premise of alliances and triple entente did not need to be antagonistic. It is a peace preparing for war.

#### To what extent did the alliance system cause war?

* The July chain reaction **is superficial**

Although all signatories were at war, the countries did not enter blindly by alliance systems and it was based on the state of their individual agendas, especially for the Triple Entente.

* Fostering **insecurity** within Germany

Germany was encircled by hostile powers and this fostered insecurity. Germany is also concerned about France and Britain's growing military strength.

* Appeal of **striking** **first** in German military

Germany would provoke a preventative war since it has the advantage to launch a first strike before rivals are fully prepared, and this came to be seen as the most effective way to improve security prospects.

## Short Term Causes: Assassination and the July Crisis

* 1914 July Crisis

	* 28 June, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne visited Sarajevo, Archduke Francis Ferdinand.

	* He is a moderate, does not oppose serbia, Serbian and Bosnian solution

	* Austria had a perfect excuse to militarily punish Serbia.

	* Austrian Foreign minister Berchtold, Emperor agreed that risking war with Russia is necessary to preserve Austria's face.

	* 5-6 July Blank Check

	* Kaiser and Chancellor promised full German support for Austria for whatever military action.

	* This 'blank cheque' was offered and both Kaiser and Chancellor recommended immediate action against Serbia assuming:

	* Russia Tsar would not support assassination of Ferdinand

	* Russia would not act without French support (which iis unlikely)

	* German government was risking but not expecting European war.

	* Austria hungary did not act until 23 July.

	* 23 July ultimatum

	* 28 July Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia

	* 29th July Britain proposed mediation.

	* 29th July Nicholas II Russian Tsar sends telegram to Wilhelm to request help in restraining Austria-Hungary and to prevent war. Germany made it clear that any Russian mobilisation would provoke German mobilisation.

	* Russia in 'period preparatory' on July 25-26, ready to fight already, to deter Austria, before Serbia rejected ultimatum.

	* Germany demanded Russia to stop.

	* Germany declared war on Russia 1st August and began mobilising France also started on this day.
