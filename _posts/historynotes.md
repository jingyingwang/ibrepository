**1 World War I**

# Causes of First World War

## Long term causes (6) (ANIMAssassinationLeaders?):

* Economy

    * 1715-1900 Industrial Revolution: must of the western world had industrialized in 19th century, so raw materials such as coal, iron and steel on a vast scale so weapons are produced easily.

    * 19th century Britain Dominance, German Rise: Britain is the most significant industrial power, and Germany(1871) starts to catch up to Britain.

        * 1880 Britain was 23% of world's output while Germany was 14.8%

        * 1910: Germany's industrial output exceeded Britain’s

        * By 1913 Britain waas 13.6^% and germany was 14.8%

    * **Post 1860s United States are also rising**: 14.6% 1880 to 32% in 1910

    * Economic Competition: economic strength imply military strength

        * Each feared being weaker

        * Iron and steel, economic assets, are important for weaoponry

        * Railways transport troops and good.

Economic changes redefined the European political landscape. It ends up becoming a motivation and causing the *sheer scale* of the war since this means a huge world war with large weapons and casualties. 

* Imperialism: The act of extending a country's political and military power to foreign countries through colonization.

    * Colonial Rivalry; Imperial Proxy Wars Germany need to distract and make  friends. Germany encourages both England and France to expand in Africa, proxy war in Africa. Italy wants North Africa, which France wants as well. Russian emperor is Prussian emperor's cousin, yet Bismarck is wary - assuming the lack of morals in everyone. Germany encourages Russia to explore Asian territories while secretly arming Japan. Bismarck directs the Austro-Hungary to the Balkans, but Bismarck arms the Ottoman empire. Bismarck instructs other Europeans to look elsewhere and turning them against each other

    * 1895 Jameson Raid - Britain and implicitly, Germany. A few days after the raid, the Kaiser of Germany sent a telegram (the 1896 "Kruger telegram") congratulating President Kruger and the Transvaal government on their success "without the help of friendly powers", alluding to potential support by Germany. When this was disclosed in the British press, it raised a storm of anti-German feeling. Dr Jameson was lionised by the press and London society, inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism. Relationship is worsened.

    * 1899-02 Boer War - Germany is friend of Dutch. Makes other european powers want to oppose Britain.

    *   1905-06 First Moroccan Crisis - Kaiser declared support for Moroccan sultan against French wishes to take over to disrupt the Anglo-French Entente. 

    * 1906 Algeciras Conference The resulting convention awarded France a controlling interest in Moroccan affairs, but guaranteed equality of trade and economic freedom for every nation and limited any colonial action by any nation without consultation with the other signatories.

    * 1911 Second Moroccan Crisis French pushed troops into the country, claiming to be defending the sultan against riots that had erupted in Fez but actually violating the terms of the Algeciras convention. When the French pushed troops into the country, claiming to be defending the sultan against riots that had erupted in Fez but actually violating the terms of the Algeciras convention. In response, Germany sent its own warship, the Panther, which arrived in the port of Agadir on May 21, intensifying the enmity between the two nations and, by extension, their allies. Europe climate had shifted into large blocs of power.

* Nationalism: an form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries

    * 1871-1914 German Nationalism

        * 1871 German unification 

            * Treaty of Frankfurt → end of Franco-Prussian War. 

            * Takes land of Alsace Lorraine. 

            * France is humiliated - pay money, lose land, host German celebration in Hall of Mirrors. 

            * It is Bismarck's Shortsightedness to challenge the most powerful - no wish to be friends with France.

            * France was humiliated in this war and had always wanted payback.

            * Despite created the new state of German Empire. In the eyes of some, it is not complete. 

            * France is not dangerous, but if it allies with Austria or Russia it might be.

            * Hence, Prussia promises a generous peace, in return Austria does not interfere with 'German affairs'. 

            * When Austria defeated, only Russia is more powerful than Germany.

            * Bismarck believes allies are made for reasons and there are no real friends: realpolitik, looking at own best practical interest.

        * 1884 MG-08 Germany produces MG-08, machine gun. Possibly what caused the war. Both Britain and Germany were practicing using these in Africa.

        * 1890-94 German New Course Wilhelm II, German Emperor dismisses Bismarck and wishes to exert more personal control on the empire. More aggressive foreign policy.

        * 1896 Weltpolitik

            * Break from realpolitik of Bismarck's era, will transform Germany into a global power through:

            * Aggressive foreign policy

            * The acquisition of overseas colonies

            * The development of a large navy (Britain...) 

    * 1914 Serbian Nationalism - Catalyst ([The BS in the Balkans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1KiFON-GWg))

        * Ottoman Empire Weakness

            * The Ottoman Empire dominated the Balkans for centuries.

            * Recently, it's been weaker - the sick man of Europe. Other powers have a chance to gain more territory.

            * Russia and A-H have ambitions in this area.

        * 1908-09 Bosnian Crisis

            * Austria-Hungary announced the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, territories formally within the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire. Germany is forced to support AH. The crisis permanently damaged relations between Austria-Hungary on one hand and Serbia, Italy and the Russian Empire on the other. Austria annexed Bosnia in the Balkans. This annoyed** **Serbia, as thousands of Serbians went under A-H control and also Serbia wanted to take over the area. Russia wanted to help Serbia, but had to back down seeing German support. Internally, Russia parliament is angry at not helping 'our Slavic brothers'.

        * 1911 Italian-Turkish War Colonial war, defeat leads to Balkan wars

        * 1912-13 Balkan Wars Serbia and other countries in the Balkans conquered most of Turkey's land in Europe with Russian support. Serbia became a powerful country, and said Austria-Hungary was its next target. AH threatens war, Russia supports Serbia.

        * 1914 Black Hands 

            * A Serbian nationalist movement that aimed to unite territories with a South Slavic majority under Serbian control using violent means, including lands held by A-H.

            * May be behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

* Industrialization: the development of industries in a country on a wide scale

    * They industrialized.

* Militarism: the belief that a country should maintain a strong military capability and be prepared to use it aggressively to defend or promote national interests

The increased ability to produce weaponry due to industrialization empowered the motivation to imperialism abroad and domestically in Europe. 

    * 1870-14 Second Industrial Revolution

This is a period of massive improvements in technology and science fueled by nationalism.

        * Louis Pasteur developed germ theory in 1860-5. 

        * He has money from French government and therefore develop vaccinations to challenge German authority, showing that France is scientifically more advanced. 

        * 'War on Science' - German pushes pharmaceutical industry. 

        * Robert Koch is a German person who began to develop vaccines. 

        * Both countries see science as a pathway to political deterrence. These vaccines were preparing for warfare.

    * Pre-1914 Arms race:

        * Russia had the largest army in 1914 (1.3 million troops) but not the strongest (outdated weapons)

        * Austria-Hungary's army more than doubled to 810000 by 1910.

        * 1906 Naval arms race: 

            * From 1815 onwards, Britain had the biggest navy in the world. It was always double the size of everyone else's.

            * This is because Britain needs to keep the military and also the trade. It was a necessity.

            * German King also wants to have a big navy. In Germany,

            * 'In 1898, the Naval Act provided for 19 battleships and 8 cruisers.'

            * 'In 1900, the second Naval Act provided for 38 battleships and 20 cruisers.'

            * In 1906, Britain develops the HMS Dreadnought and destroys its own navy. 

            * Dreadnought was a class of ships that is faster, better armed and can travel further, runs on steam power.

            * It made all the other ships obsolete.

            * Kaiser sees the ship and wants it. 

            * They began competing who can make the most Dreadnoughts. 

            * By 1914, Germany had 17 Dreadnoughts while Britain had 29. 

            * Both sides received massive public support.

            * It was economically impossible for the Germans to close the gap before the war broke out.

            * By the time of war, Britain was still the biggest navy in the world.

* Military plans

New military weapons meant new plans. Rather than having a small conflict, every nation jumped in with their own plans and that's why WWI became such a large scale conflict.

    * 1903 Schlieffen Plan

        * Aims to prevent war against eastern border with Russia and western border with France simultaneously

        * reaction of German fear of encirclement - created in 1903, which means to attack the French first, just like in 1871. Launch attack from Alsace-Lorraine, main attack will come through Belgium to Northern France: need to move fast. Hit France first, then focus on all Russians. Changes and adaptions are relied on # of factors:

        * Superiority of the German Military - higher mobility, greater firepower (after 1908, MG-08 machine gun), better training.

        * Plan is based on Russian army of circa 1900s - huge armies, not industrialized, lacked railways → slow mobilizations. Early July, Russia starts to mobilize the armies since they know that they are slow. 

        * For France and Russia, yet now it's Triple Entente - Britain will also get troops to help France, Britain will get troops to France through navy and land on certain ports. Adapted to ensure Britain does not get troops to France fast enough - changes plan at last minute. Break out from German Hook, German troops will capture certain deepwater ports.

        * Schlieffen plan did not work, yet cannot stop. In Britain, mobilization is also growing out of control. The Plan is what started the fighting.

    * Russian plans:

        * Rapidly move against Germany so it **mobilized first** in order to counter logistical problems

    * 1913 France Plan XVII: launching against Germany on shared border

    * Britain plan:

        * Send their army to France in the event of war

        * Concentrate to destroy Germany's navy to hinder supplies, and hence weaken German economy and morale

* **Alliance systems:**

* Alliance System: The two power blocs of countries in World War I, Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/UjsEUwr4fapfE4SUwS9qcw_img_0.png)

**Date of Key Alliances:**

* 1879 Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria, forming Triple Alliance by 1882 with Italy.

* 1887 Reinsurance Treaty with Germany and Russia, a short alliance by Bismarck immediately after the collapse of Dreikaiserbund (G,R,A to isolate France). Breaks by 1890.

* 1891-92 Franco-Russian Alliance. Germany isolated.

* 1904 Entente Cordiale between France and Britain. Unite against should Germany attack. Defensive.

* 1907 **Triple Entente **between France, Britain and Russia against Germany.

#### Triple Alliance: Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary

* Secret alliance, defensive alliance

#### Triple Entente: Britain, France and Russia (much later than the triple alliance)

* Not an alliance: the agreement to not help the enemy. No one knew the full story behind the treaties.

* France goes to Russia first, and Russia dominates in Eastern Europe, yet they do not know yet the weakness of Russian society.

* In **1904**, all of Europe laughed at Russia: it lost the **Russo-Japanese** **War**. Britain, France and America impose peace settlement in which Japan gives back land from war to a divided up China, for the economic benefit of these countries.

*All alliances were formed with a motivation that is somewhat related to Germany: Germany fears isolation while others fear German strength.*

It is important to note that the premise of alliances and triple entente did not need to be antagonistic. It is a peace preparing for war.

#### To what extent did the alliance system cause war?

* The July chain reaction **is superficial**

Although all signatories were at war, the countries did not enter blindly by alliance systems and it was based on the state of their individual agendas, especially for the Triple Entente.

* Fostering **insecurity** within Germany

Germany was encircled by hostile powers and this fostered insecurity. Germany is also concerned about France and Britain's growing military strength.

* Appeal of **striking** **first** in German military

Germany would provoke a preventative war since it has the advantage to launch a first strike before rivals are fully prepared, and this came to be seen as the most effective way to improve security prospects.

## Short Term Causes: Assassination and the July Crisis

* 1914 July Crisis

    * 28 June, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne visited Sarajevo, Archduke Francis Ferdinand.

    * He is a moderate, does not oppose serbia, Serbian and Bosnian solution

    * Serbian nationalists had time to make plans to assassinate him.

    * All assassination attempts failed but chance means that Princip, a Serbian nationalist,  killed Ferdinand and wife.

    * Europe was shocked and Austria and Serbia seemed need to showdown.

    * Austria had a perfect excuse to militarily punish Serbia.

    * Austrian Foreign minister Berchtold, Emperor agreed that risking war with Russia is necessary to preserve Austria's face.

    * 5-6 July Blank Check

    * Kaiser and Chancellor promised full German support for Austria for whatever military action.

    * This 'blank cheque' was offered and both Kaiser and Chancellor recommended immediate action against Serbia assuming:

    * Russia Tsar would not support assassination of Ferdinand

    * Russia would not act without French support (which iis unlikely)

    * German government was risking but not expecting European war.

    * Austria hungary did not act until 23 July.

    * 23 July ultimatum

    * Austria-Hungary presented an ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July.

    * It is very severe and certain that Serbia would reject within 48 hr time limit.

    * Russia promised to support, Serbian government expected war.

    * Austria immediately severed diplomatic relations and declared war on Jul 28.

    * 24-25 July Russian support

    * Sazonov, Russia foreign minister, interpreted Austrian ultimatum as deliberate provocation.

    * Fellow slav state was being threatened by Germanic powers.

    * Russian prestige in the Balkans was at stake.

    * Russia's position in Balcans would collapse if it abandoms Serbia.

    * Russia does not want to repeat its mistake in the 1908-09 Bosnian Crisis.

    * Russia mobilized first.

    * 26th July Attempt at Peace Britain tried to arrange a diplomatic conference on the 26th July, many countries agreed to come but Germany refused to attend. The conference never met. 

    * 28 July Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia

    * 29th July Britain proposed mediation.

    * 29th July Nicholas II Russian Tsar sends telegram to Wilhelm to request help in restraining Austria-Hungary and to prevent war. Germany made it clear that any Russian mobilisation would provoke German mobilisation.

    * Russia in 'period preparatory' on July 25-26, ready to fight already, to deter Austria, before Serbia rejected ultimatum.

    * Germany demanded Russia to stop.

    * Germany declared war on Russia 1st August and began mobilising France also started on this day.

    * Germany asked France for neutrality, and when there is no reply Germany declared war on France on 3rd August.

    * Germany demand passage through Belgium 2nd August, prepared to guarantee independence to it.

    * Belgian government rejected Germany's request, German troops invaded Belgium.

    * Great powers guaranteed Belgian nutrality in 1839 impacted Britain. Britain must defend Belgium and its ultimatum was rejected, Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August.

# World War 1

## Summary of World War 1

* **Thought to be a short war over by Christmas:**

    * Became a long war of exhaustion.

* The first example of modern total war

* Impacts all civilians through conscription and women, children in medical services

* Economy of a country prioritizes war

* Countries mobilized resources on an unprecedented scale

* Blurs distinction between civilians and combatants.

* Tactical thinking did not always evolve despite new weapons shaping the nature of conflict

* [Western Front](https://i.imgur.com/f5Syvtw.png): Primarily in Belgium and France

    * The mobile warfare of first month turned into stalemate and trench warfare.

* Eastern Front: Russia

    * Russia mobilized faster than predicted.

## The Western Front

* August-Early September: fighting in France and Belgium

    * Rapid German assault as per the Schlieffen Plan and rapid French retreat.

    * Germany occupied Luxembourg in the first 3 days

    * Germany occupies Brussels (Belgian Capital) in 20 days

    * **4 August: **Germany violates 1839 Treaty of London of Belgian neutrality protected by Britain; used it to declare war on Germany.

        * Britain wanted to enter the war anyways to defeat Germany.

        * Britain is scared that French defeat will mean that Germany dominates Europe and will capture French navy against Britain (The Channel! So charringly close!)

    * At forts of **Liege **Belgian defence is stubborn and, exhaustion/failing supply lines slow Germany; but ultimately captured by artillery

    * Arrival of British Expeditionary Force (**150000, Britain's best soldiers**) changed everything

    * 23 August 1914: Battle of Mons

        * Belgium, around Antwerpen

        * The first major action of BEF in WWI, German advance was slowed.

        * Numerically superior Germans, BEF was forced to retreat as Germans were stronger and French army suddenly retreated. There were about 7000 casualties in total.

        * Germany was halted just outside of Paris at the Battle of Marne

    * Late August: Failure of the Schlieffen Plan

        * Germany cannot keep up with the Schlieffen Plan anymore they walk slower than 30/40km per day.

        * Germany cannot get supplies due to a failing railway system.

        * The nearest available **railheads **(where military supplies are unloaded) are 135km away.

        * This meant that Schlieffen Plan will fail as it is important that the blocks are in order so enemies cannot exploit gaps.

    * 6-12 September 1914: First Battle of the Marne

        * Counter attack by France and BEF forced German army to stop and retreat northwest, first Allied victory against Germany in the West.

        * Led to First BAttle of Aisne and Race to the Sea.

        * Led to four years of Trench Warfare and stalemate on the WF.

        * Turned the tides: up until this point, the entire Allied army is forced into retreat back towards Paris. Saved the Entente powers.

    * The majority of soldiers killed during this time are well-trained and professional, and they were replaced by fresh recruits and they are not well-trained. 

        * The nature of the war changed from one of fast movement and advanced military tactics to defensive warfare and attrition.

* September - December 1914: Attrition and Movement

    * Change of German tactics

        * Schlieffen Plan: strike France quickly, capture Paris, force French to surrender. Belgium refusal to cooperate changed the plan as more German troops were needed to force there way through Belgium. 

        * British joining in Belgium meant that plan was adapted further.

        * Germany Army Supreme Command (OHL) decided to divert troops from pushing towards Paris to capturing the Belgian deep-water ports to prevent British reinforcements from arriving there.

        * **October 1914:** All Belgian ports were under German Control.

        * British is forced to resupply forces through French ports such as Dunkirk.

        * Resulted in less men and artillery in German armies who are attacking Paris.

    * Change of nature of warfare

        * Senior officers were surprised : old-school tactics meets modern technology.

        * Technology favors the defending side over attacking side

    * Advantages of the defense over the offense:

        * **Trench warfare:** the defending armies dug trenches into the ground and waited for the enemy to attack. Attackers has to cross open space and defenders may shoot them from behind cover

        * **Machine guns:** Machine guns are too heavy to move, and they are only fired in stationary positions and hence ideal for use in defense but not at all in attack.

            * In 1914 Britain produced 300 while Germany 500, by 1918 Britain produced 120900 while Germany produced 13000.

            * produced in greater quantities and deployed to greater tactical advantage.

        * **Barbed wire: **Attackers cannot charge into enemy trenches as they were slowed down by having to go through them while being shot at. Barbed wire in front of the trenches gave defenders more time and accuracy to shoot attackers.

        * **Untrained recruits:** Defensive warfare require less training and this led to both sides to adopt defensive strategies to dig trenches and wait for the enemy to attack them.

        * **Failed cavalry (horseback charging)**: old-school strength of army is suicidal by modern standards and cannot be used against entrenched enemy.

    * Offence tactics used:

        * **Preliminary artillery bombardment**: artillery shells bombard trenches and halt once the advance begins; kills tropps and destroys machine guns and cuts barbed wire, weakens trenches; weaknesses include inaccuracy and giving warning to enemy, as well as useless against trench reinforcements

        * **Creeping barrage:** Artillery used simultaneously with advance and set to explode just before the advancing troops; provides continuous cover and destroys enemy; weaknesses include bad synchronization and inaccuracies as well as limited communications, leading to casualties from friendly fire

        * **Mines:** lay mines under enemy trenches through underground tunnels; creates breech in enemy front line. Weaknesses include that digging tunnels are dangerous and miners could be killed, as well as inaccurate/delayed detonation

        * **Poison gas: **Release of poison gas from canisters or fired towards enemy trenches, causes panic and kills enemy troops. Weaknesses include that when wind changes direction it is blown back to friendly troops and gas masks were invented to defend. Also violates international code of war.

        * **Tanks:** Invented by the british to support infantry advance; provides firepower and cover in advancing in no-man's-land. Only from 1916 onwards and are often broken down.

            * First used at Battle of the Somme and it was badly used. 

        * **Artillery tactics**: refined by Germans and aircraft.

            * Initially, airplanes were used as observers or spies, they are unarmed.

            * However, they changed and pilots started carrying guns.

            * By 1915, fighter aircrafts have guns built into their wings.

            * German planes are better than Allied plans.

            * Germans have *Zeppelin* airships which fly further and higher than airplanes.

            * Pilots became propaganda celebrities and the air war was portrayed as clean, noble and heroic.

    * 17 September - 19 October 1914 Race to the Sea

        * German army felt difficulty in overcoming defensive trenches.

        * Germany began **outflanking**(gaining advantage by going around an enemy's position) F&B defensive lines by going around them to the North.

        * B&F went further north to outflank the Germans.

        * Neither side could advance very much and more trenches were dug, which will dominate the war on the Western Front for 4 years.

        * The armies were going further north to French and Belgian coast and the Channel.

        * Eventually they faced off each other in October-November 1914 had Germans launch a massive assult against Belgian and French troops.

        * **28 October 1914** Belgians flood the field around River Ijzer to stop German advance, prevented Germans from capturing a port.

    * The German trenches are better with concrete walls and communication trenches and reinforced concrete bunkers.

* Stalemate: Situation after November 1914. Domestically, profits from militarism, soldiers are miserable and war propaganda saturates nations.

    * Britain enlarges commitment to other theatres of war like in the Ottoman Empire.

* 1915 Second Battle of Ypres: 22 April - 25 May 1915

    * Germany attempted to break the stalemate by advancing against the Allied troops.

    * Used the poison gas for the first time. Has psychological impact.

    * 60000 Casualties in Allied, 35000 Germans - heavy casualties

    * Minimal territorial gain by Germany.

    * Gas created panic and troops escaped from trenches, allying the German's to attack.  

* Characteristic of War in 1916

    * Huge battles of attrition with enormous casualties and little territorial gain

    * Unbroken stalemate

* 1916 Battle of Verdun: 21 February – 18 December

    * Late 1914, German Army Commander Erich von Falkenhayn decided to launch massive assault against French.

    * Plan to attack as ite of high emotional value and force them to defend it at all costs: fortress at Verdun-sur-Meuse in north eastern France.

    * **21 Feb 1916:** German army launched operation *Gericht* and attacks heavily fortified locations defended by French. 

        * French commander told men to not withdraw at any cost.

        * The next eleven months, the German forces attempted to destroy Verdun.

        * Longest battle of the entire war.

        * First use of new assault tactics.

        * The Germans were convinced that enough casualties will force France to surrender. 

        * Germans did not succeed and French did not surrender.

    * French casualties amount to 542000 but they still held Verdun.

    * German casualties amount to 434000.

    * After 10 months, Germany only held 8km more territory.

*  1 July - 18 November 1916: Battle of the Somme

    * "Futility and waste of war, lions led by donkeys"

    * Exemplifies attrition strategy.

    * 'Suicidal battle'

    * B&F want to relieve some pressure on Verdun and break stalemate.

    * B&F wanted to attack Germany against German trenches near River Somme.

    * Leading up to July 1916, British and French decided to increase ammo production and built a new secret weapon: the tank, preparing for massive assault to launch against German trenches. However, they were ineffective and did not help Britain.

    * Classic tactics of trench warfare was used.

    * Before the attack, there was a week-long artillery bombardment where 1 million + shells to be dropped on German trenches. However, this was ineffective as German trenches are assumed by B&F to be weak like their own but it was actually strong. Instaed, the artillery actually made it more difficult to attack and warned the Germans that they are coming by stopping the bombardment when the signal for soldiers to charge is happening.

    * B&F attacked on 1st of July and advanced slowly through no-man's-land (the space between trenches) and tried to throw grenades in. 

    * Germans stayed behind trenches and killed so many: British casualties on the first day is 60000+ killed or seriously wounded.

    * British Pal's Battalions: effort to boost recuitment by ensuring that people from the same town served in the same regiment together resulted in entire areas of Britain waking up to men killed.

    * Lasted until November.

    * In total, 420000 British and 200000 French casualties, 500000 German.

    * Allies only advanced 13km in some places.

    * Germans gained very little ground.

    * Also became battle of attrition despite not being the intention.

    * Relieved the pressure of defenders of Verdun as Germans are attacked from behind and Germans need to send troops to both sides.

* 1917: Unbroken stalemate

    * Allied victory was imminent. 

    * Victories are achieved by the tank.

    * USA enters the war to help the Allieds.

* 1917 Nivelle Offensive: 16 April - 9 May

    * French offensive
